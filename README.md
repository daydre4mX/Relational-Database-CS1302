This was a CS1302 project that involved us having to write a relational database from scratch in Python.


If for some reason you want to try to run this, the package PLY is required.

```
pip install PLY
```

The driver and query programs are test cases made to ensure everything is working properly.

The main entry point is RA.py under /phase2.
